# PREDICTING-RICE-DISEASES-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
his project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automate the detection of rice diseases from leaf images, achieving over 84 percent accuracy. It provides farmers with a cost-effective and scalable solution for early disease identification, improving crop health and food security.
